# School Library Website (11th Grade Project)

This is a simple website I built during my 11th grade for my school library.
The goal was to make NCERT and other reference books available in PDF format through a single, easy-to-access platform.
Screenshots of the project can be viewed here: [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nYydzBX2IWRK8L-McrF2mriwWSoBm2un)

## Features

* NCERT PDF Repository – Centralized collection of NCERT textbooks.
* Additional Books – A few reference books were added alongside NCERTs.
* Search Functionality – A search bar to look up books by title/keyword.
* Category Filter – Option to filter books by subject or category (functionality uncertain).
* About Us Page – Basic details about the website/library.
* Send Us a Message Section – Intended for feedback or queries (not functional).
* Book Recommendations Page – Section meant for book suggestions (likely incomplete).

## Tech Stack

* **HTML/CSS** for structure and styling.
* **JavaScript** for basic interactivity (search/filter attempted).
* **Static Files** (PDFs, images) directly linked.
* No backend or database integration.

## Limitations

* The “Send Us a Message” form did not have backend support.
* Book recommendations and filters were experimental and may not have worked fully.
* All resources were hardcoded/static with no dynamic upload or database support.

## Purpose

The project was created as a learning exercise, not a production-ready site. It helped me understand:

* How to organize and link resources in a website.
* The basics of navigation, layout, and simple UI/UX.
* Early experimentation with forms and search functions.

## Lessons Learned

* Static sites are limited without backend functionality.
* Features should be built and tested incrementally.
* A clean layout improves usability even in basic projects.
* Hands-on practice is essential for understanding how web components fit together.

*This project is archived here as an example of my early web development work and learning process.*
